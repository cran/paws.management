\title{Creates an account-level data protection policy or subscription filter
policy that applies to all log groups or a subset of log groups in the
account}
\usage{
cloudwatchlogs_put_account_policy(
  policyName,
  policyDocument,
  policyType,
  scope = NULL,
  selectionCriteria = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{policyName}{[required] A name for the policy. This must be unique within the account.}

\item{policyDocument}{[required] Specify the policy, in JSON.

\strong{Data protection policy}

A data protection policy must include two JSON blocks:
\itemize{
\item The first block must include both a \code{DataIdentifer} array and an
\code{Operation} property with an \code{Audit} action. The \code{DataIdentifer}
array lists the types of sensitive data that you want to mask. For
more information about the available options, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/}{Types of data that you can mask}.

The \code{Operation} property with an \code{Audit} action is required to find
the sensitive data terms. This \code{Audit} action must contain a
\code{FindingsDestination} object. You can optionally use that
\code{FindingsDestination} object to list one or more destinations to
send audit findings to. If you specify destinations such as log
groups, Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must already exist.
\item The second block must include both a \code{DataIdentifer} array and an
\code{Operation} property with an \code{Deidentify} action. The
\code{DataIdentifer} array must exactly match the \code{DataIdentifer} array
in the first block of the policy.

The \code{Operation} property with the \code{Deidentify} action is what
actually masks the data, and it must contain the \code{ "MaskConfig": {}}
object. The \code{ "MaskConfig": {}} object must be empty.
}

For an example data protection policy, see the \strong{Examples} section on
this page.

The contents of the two \code{DataIdentifer} arrays must match exactly.

In addition to the two JSON blocks, the \code{policyDocument} can also
include \code{Name}, \code{Description}, and \code{Version} fields. The \code{Name} is
different than the operation's \code{policyName} parameter, and is used as a
dimension when CloudWatch Logs reports audit findings metrics to
CloudWatch.

The JSON specified in \code{policyDocument} can be up to 30,720 characters
long.

\strong{Subscription filter policy}

A subscription filter policy can include the following attributes in a
JSON block:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DestinationArn} The ARN of the destination to deliver log events
to. Supported destinations are:
\itemize{
\item An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the
subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
\item An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription
policy, for same-account delivery.
\item A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription
policy, for same-account delivery.
\item A logical destination in a different account created with
\code{\link[=cloudwatchlogs_put_destination]{put_destination}}, for
cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are
supported as logical destinations.
}
\item \strong{RoleArn} The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs
permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination
stream. You don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with
a logical destination for cross-account delivery.
\item \strong{FilterPattern} A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered
stream of log events.
\item \strong{Distribution} The method used to distribute log data to the
destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the
grouping can be set to \code{Random} for a more even distribution. This
property is only applicable when the destination is an Kinesis Data
Streams data stream.
}}

\item{policyType}{[required] The type of policy that you're creating or updating.}

\item{scope}{Currently the only valid value for this parameter is \code{ALL}, which
specifies that the data protection policy applies to all log groups in
the account. If you omit this parameter, the default of \code{ALL} is used.}

\item{selectionCriteria}{Use this parameter to apply the subscription filter policy to a subset
of log groups in the account. Currently, the only supported filter is
\verb{LogGroupName NOT IN []}. The \code{selectionCriteria} string can be up to
25KB in length. The length is determined by using its UTF-8 bytes.

Using the \code{selectionCriteria} parameter is useful to help prevent
infinite loops. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Subscriptions-recursion-prevention.html}{Log recursion prevention}.

Specifing \code{selectionCriteria} is valid only when you specify
\code{ SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY} for \code{policyType}.}
