\description{
Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet
issues impact the performance and availability between your applications
hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can reduce the time
it takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to minutes.
Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web Services
captures from its global networking footprint to calculate a baseline of
performance and availability for internet traffic. This is the same data
that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and
availability. With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor
raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your
end users in the different geographic locations where your application
runs.

Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and
CloudWatch Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health
information for geographies and networks specific to your application.
Internet Monitor sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you
can set up notifications. If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web
Services network, you also automatically receive an Amazon Web Services
Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is
taking to mitigate the problem.

To use Internet Monitor, you create a \emph{monitor} and associate your
application's resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions,
or WorkSpaces directories - so Internet Monitor can determine where your
application's internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides
internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the
locations and ASNs (typically, internet service providers or ISPs) that
communicate with your application.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html}{Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor}
in the \emph{Amazon CloudWatch User Guide}.
