\title{Returns a list of controls from Audit Manager}
\usage{
auditmanager_list_controls(
  controlType,
  nextToken = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL,
  controlCatalogId = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{controlType}{[required] A filter that narrows the list of controls to a specific type.}

\item{nextToken}{The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of results on a page or for an API request call.}

\item{controlCatalogId}{A filter that narrows the list of controls to a specific resource from
the Amazon Web Services Control Catalog.

To use this parameter, specify the ARN of the Control Catalog resource.
You can specify either a control domain, a control objective, or a
common control. For information about how to find the ARNs for these
resources, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomains.html}{\code{ListDomains}}
,
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListObjectives.html}{\code{ListObjectives}}
, and
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListCommonControls.html}{\code{ListCommonControls}}
.

You can only filter by one Control Catalog resource at a time.
Specifying multiple resource ARNs isnâ€™t currently supported. If you want
to filter by more than one ARN, we recommend that you run the
\code{\link[=auditmanager_list_controls]{list_controls}} operation separately for
each ARN.

Alternatively, specify \code{UNCATEGORIZED} to list controls that aren't
mapped to a Control Catalog resource. For example, this operation might
return a list of custom controls that don't belong to any control domain
or control objective.}
